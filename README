# Proto

A prototype game being built up over time, currently intended to just flesh
out various ideas for a 2d top-down style RPG, preferrably with randomized
components spread throughout.

## Building

The build process should be easy, simply run `make all` to create the entire
game. Then you can run by entering the `bin/` directory and running `./proto`
from in there.

## License

Currently no license, not sure what I'm going to end up going with once I
start fleshing out the actual game. The main.c file is fairly open for grabs
at the moment, given that it's almost all just boilerplate SDL2 stuff.
